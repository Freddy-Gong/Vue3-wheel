# About

Fusion UI is a UI component based on Vue 3 and TypeScript.

In fact, this component was written by me in order to learn Vue 3 and Vite. I wrote it all by myself. I try not to use third-party libraries, including the official website you see now.

It is not strongly recommended that you use this UI library for a production environment. But if you come with the intention of looking at the source code, the library is worth a look. The source code is located at github.com/freddy-Gong/Vue3-wheel, and the historical submissions are so regular that you can view them one by one in the order they are submitted. You can also view the source code and examples of each component directly. See readme.md for how to run it.
